### Building Energy and Emissions Performance by Property Type - BenchmarkYYC
### About
This data is sourced from the City of Calgary's BEnchmarkYYC building energy benchmarking program, which is a voluntary program. Energy and emissions data is typically reported to the program between July and December of each year

Buildings eligible to participate in the program include any sized commercial, institutional, or non-profit building within city limits.

The dataset provides standardized information on building energy consumption, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions and also highlights opportunities for prioritizing underperforming buildings for energy efficiency improvement measures
